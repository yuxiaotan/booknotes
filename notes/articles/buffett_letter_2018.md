# Warren Buffett 2018 Letter to Shareholders

A new GAAP rule forces BKA to report unrealized capital gains and losses. Buffett is asking investors to pay attention ot **operating earnings** and not unrealized gains/losses.  
"Over time, [we] expect [our portfolio] to deliver substantial gains, but with irregular timing." - Buffett
